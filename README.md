## Projects
***Covid Dashboard in Tableau***
[Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidDashboardSkenney/SaraKenneyQMB6358CovidDashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

I developed a COVID-19 Dashboard for the State of Florida as a project for my Data Analytics course at the University of South Florida. The dashboard looks at population characteristics like age and sex and explores the data using the story functionality of Tableau. My goal was to understand the current level of COVID-19 in the community, the rate of spread, and vaccination rates. I found that counties with low vaccination rates were associated with higher levels of COVID-19 in the community.

***Investigation of Utah Air Quality in Tableau***
[Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/AsthmaProject_Publish/Story1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This was a capstone project exploring air quality and asthma in Utah for my Data Visualization course at the University of South Florida. I pulled data from multiple sources including the EPA (2017 National Emissions Inventory, Air Quality Statistics Report), US Census(ACS Survey 2020, 5-Year Estimates Health Insurance), Utah Department of Health IBIS(Asthma, Pop Estimates), and UGRC (oil and gas sites.) I found a high correlation between ozone and asthma rates and a possible link between oil and gas sites and asthma. However, geography also plays a role because of the way the mountains trap air pollution along the Wasatch and Uinta Mountain ranges.

This is a microeconomics paper exploring the economic causes of the toilet paper crisis in the US during the Covid-19 pandemic. A variety of factors lead to the national shortage of toilet paper including the reduced demand for commercial TP due to quarantine and more people working from home. I concluded that toilet paper prices will continue to rise as demand has become more inelastic and less reactive to price increases.
