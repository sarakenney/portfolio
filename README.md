***Covid Dashboard in Tableau***
[Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidDashboardSkenney/SaraKenneyQMB6358CovidDashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

I developed a COVID-19 Dashboard for the State of Florida as a project for my Data Analytics course at the University of South Florida. The dashboard looks at population characteristics like age and sex and explores the data using the story functionality of Tableau. My goal was to understand the current level of COVID-19 in the community, the rate of spread, and vaccination rates. I found that counties with low vaccination rates were associated with higher levels of COVID-19 in the community.

***Investigation of Utah Air Quality in Tableau***
[Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/AsthmaProject_Publish/Story1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This was a capstone project exploring air quality and asthma in Utah for my Data Visualization course at the University of South Florida. I pulled data from multiple sources including the EPA (2017 National Emissions Inventory, Air Quality Statistics Report), US Census(ACS Survey 2020, 5-Year Estimates Health Insurance), Utah Department of Health IBIS(Asthma, Pop Estimates), and UGRC (oil and gas sites.) I found a high correlation between ozone and asthma rates and a possible link between oil and gas sites and asthma. However, geography also plays a role because of the way the mountains trap air pollution along the Wasatch and Uinta Mountain ranges.

This was my final project for the MBA Capstone course at the University of South Florida. I researched trends in sustainability impacting the automotive sector and recommendations for automotive companies reagarding sustainability including: incorporating the circular economy, transitioning to service models, and pursuing a Just Transition along with DEI goals. 

***MicroEconomics Research on the TP Crisis During Covid***

This is a microeconomics paper exploring the economic causes of the toilet paper crisis in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. A variety of factors lead to the national shortage of toilet paper including the reduced demand for commercial TP due to quarantine and more people working from home. I concluded that toilet paper prices will continue to rise as demand has become more inelastic and less reactive to price increases. 

***Glass Ceiling Data Analysis***

In this paper, I use Census Bureau and American Community Survey data to answer questions about why women continue to face a gender-based pay gap in the United States. I conducted regression analysis as well as geospatial analysis in ArcGIS to better understand and visualize the data. I found that women make less than men across all industries, but even more so in financial activities, mining, and manufacturing. These were the three worst industries for women’s earnings as a percentage of men’s earnings. Also, women tended to make up a greater percentage of the workforce in the industries with pay gaps above the average, potentially indicating fewer women in leadership positions.
