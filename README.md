[Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidDashboardSkenney/SaraKenneyQMB6358CovidDashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
I developed a COVID-19 Dashboard for the State of Florida for my Data Analytics course at University of South Florida. The dashboard looks at population characteristics like age and sex and explores the data using the story functionality of Tablea. My goal was to understand the current level of Covid-19 in the community, the rate of spread, and vaccination rates. I found that counties with low vaccination rates were associated with higher levels of covid in the community.
